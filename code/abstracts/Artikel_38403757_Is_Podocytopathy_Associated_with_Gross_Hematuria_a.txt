We experienced three cases of a fever and subsequent severe, prolonged gross 
hematuria after COVID-19 vaccination. A kidney biopsy revealed immunoglobulin A 
(IgA) nephropathy, and electron microscopy showed two types of podocytopathy 
(podocyte damage): loss of foot processes from the glomerular basement membrane 
and foot process effacement. Mesangial interposition was also present in cases 1 
and 3 but not in case 2. Podocytopathy is known to be a cause of proteinuria; 
however, the reactions to COVID-19 vaccination described here suggest that it 
may also be related to hematuria in IgA nephropathy.
