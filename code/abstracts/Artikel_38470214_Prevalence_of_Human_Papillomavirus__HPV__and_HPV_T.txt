BACKGROUND: In Denmark, a girls-only human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination 
program was initiated in 2008-2009. The study aim was to assess the HPV 
prevalence and type distribution in younger men prior to HPV vaccination in men.
METHODS: The study population was younger men who attended information days 
regarding military service. At random days (2019-2020), 280 men were included. 
We collected questionnaire data regarding risk factors for HPV infection and a 
penile swab for HPV testing. We compared results in this study with those from a 
previous study of young men (2006-2007).
RESULTS: The majority of participants (94%) were 18-20 years old. The median 
number of lifetime sexual partners was 4. Altogether, 130 men (46.4%) were HPV 
positive. No infections with HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, and 45 were detected. 
The most frequent type was HPV-51 (detected in 11.1%). Comparison showed that 
the odds of high-risk HPV type infection were higher in 2019-2020 (prevalence 
odds ratio [POR], 1.7 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.1-2.7]) compared with 
2006-2007. In contrast, the odds were lower (POR, 0.3 [95% CI, .1-.6]) for HPV 
types targeted by the 9-valent HPV vaccine.
CONCLUSIONS: The multicohort girls-only vaccination program has to a large 
degree protected young men against the HPV types included in the licensed 
vaccines. This does not speak against gender-neutral vaccination as the HPV 
prevalence is still high, although consisting largely of less carcinogenic HPV 
types.
