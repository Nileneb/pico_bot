BACKGROUND: Digital health literacy (DHL) is pivotal for individuals to access 
trustworthy health information and make informed decisions, closely intertwined 
with health behaviors and psychological resilience-these factors collectively 
shape an individual's approach to health management. Despite extensive research 
on digital health literacy in broader populations, the specific dynamics of 
digital health literacy in relation to health behaviors and psychological 
resilience among undergraduate nursing students in China remain understudied, 
highlighting a gap that this research endeavors to address. This study aims to 
assess the levels of digital health literacy among undergraduate nursing 
students in China, and to explore its association with health lifestyles and 
psychological resilience, which are considered influential factors.
METHODS: Employing a descriptive cross-sectional research design, eligible 
Chinese nursing undergraduates were surveyed from June to October 2023. This 
study recruited a total of 418 undergraduate nursing students. After excluding 
11 students on leave, 407 students participated in questionnaire completion and 
submission. The College Students' Digital Health Literacy Scale, Healthy 
Lifestyle Assessment Scale and The Psychological Resilience Scale were used in 
this study.
RESULTS: The mean scores for digital health literacy, health lifestyles, and 
psychological resilience were 74.78 ± 8.44, 127.14 ± 11.22, and 79.21 ± 11.02, 
respectively. Pearson correlation analysis results indicated that the 
correlations between digital health literacy and both health lifestyles 
(r = 0.707, P < 0.01) and psychological resilience (r = 0.638, P < 0.01) were 
statistically significant and positive. The multiple linear regression analysis 
revealed that volunteer activity experience, academic performance, physical 
fitness, psychological traits, health lifestyle, and psychological resilience 
significantly predicted digital health literacy (F = 58.091, P < 0.001, R² = 
0.678, adjusted R² = 0.666). Specifically, excellent academic performance 
(β = 0.210, P < 0.001) and good physical fitness (β = 0.188, P = 0.002) were the 
strongest predictors of higher digital health literacy.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a correlation between the digital health literacy of 
nursing undergraduates and their health lifestyles and psychological resilience. 
Future research should consider interventions in digital health literacy for 
undergraduate nursing students in China from the perspectives of health 
lifestyles and psychological resilience.
