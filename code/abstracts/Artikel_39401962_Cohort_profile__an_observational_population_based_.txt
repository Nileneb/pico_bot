PURPOSE: VAccine Study COVID-19 (VASCO) is a cohort study with a 5-year 
follow-up that was initiated when COVID-19 vaccination was introduced in the 
Netherlands. The primary objective is to estimate real-world vaccine 
effectiveness (VE) of COVID-19 vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the 
Netherlands, overall and in four subpopulations defined by age and medical risk.
PARTICIPANTS: The cohort consists of 45 547 community-dwelling participants aged 
18-85 years who were included irrespective of their COVID-19 vaccination status 
or intention to get vaccinated. A medical risk condition is present in 4289 
(19.8%) of 21 679 individuals aged 18-59 years, and in 9135 (38.3%) of 23 821 
individuals aged 60-85 years. After 1 year of follow-up, 5502 participants had 
dropped out of the study. At inclusion and several times after inclusion, 
participants are asked to take a self-collected fingerprick blood sample in 
which nucleoprotein and spike protein receptor binding domain-specific antibody 
concentrations are assessed. Participants are also asked to complete monthly 
digital questionnaires in the first year, and 3 monthly in years 2-5, including 
questions on sociodemographic factors, health status, COVID-19 vaccination, 
SARS-CoV-2-related symptoms and testing results, and behavioural responses to 
COVID-19 measures.
FINDINGS TO DATE: VASCO data have been used to describe VE against SARS-CoV-2 
infection of primary vaccination, first and second booster and bivalent 
boosters, the impact of hybrid immunity on SARS-CoV-2 infection and VE against 
infectiousness. Furthermore, data were used to describe antibody response 
following vaccination and breakthrough infections and to investigate the 
relation between antibody response and reactogenicity.
FUTURE PLANS: VASCO will be able to contribute to policy decision-making 
regarding future COVID-19 vaccination. Furthermore, VASCO provides an 
infrastructure to conduct further studies and to respond to changes in 
vaccination campaigns and testing policy, and new virus variants.
