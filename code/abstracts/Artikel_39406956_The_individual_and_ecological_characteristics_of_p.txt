Vaccination is a highly effective method to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and 
mitigate severe disease. In Germany, adult vaccination rates are relatively high 
at 85.5%, but rates are significantly lower for adolescents (69.6%) and children 
(20.0%). This discrepancy indicates that not all vaccinated parents choose to 
vaccinate their children. Analyzing data from a January 2022 online survey of 
1,819 parents with children and adolescents, we explore the socio-economic 
factors influencing parents' willingness to vaccinate themselves and their 
children. Our results show that individuals who vote for either side of the 
political extremes are less likely to vaccinate their children. This pattern is 
particularly strong for voters on the far right. In addition, we find that 
better educated parents are more likely to vaccinate both themselves and their 
children. Parents who vaccinate both themselves and their children demonstrate 
greater confidence in the vaccine's effectiveness, while those who vaccinate 
only themselves are often motivated by a desire to regain personal freedoms. 
These insights highlight the need for targeted public health strategies to 
address specific concerns and improve vaccination rates among children and 
adolescents.
