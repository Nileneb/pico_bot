BACKGROUND: The Netherlands is one of few countries worldwide which has used the 
bivalent HPV vaccine for girls-only for over a decade. This allows assessment of 
vaccine effectiveness (VE) against female genital HPV DNA-positivity of this 
vaccine in an observational post-licencing real-world setting. Additionally, it 
is unclear whether catch-up vaccination campaigns result in similar VE as 
routine vaccination. Therefore, type-specific and grouped VE were assessed and 
compared for women who had been eligible for catch-up vaccination at 13-16 years 
with those who had been eligible for routine vaccination at 12 years.
METHODS: PASSYON is a Dutch biennial repeated cross-sectional (2011-2021) study 
among sexual health clinic clients aged 16-24 years old. Women provided 
self-collected vaginal samples, questionnaires on demographics and sexual 
behaviour were administered, and women self-reported HPV vaccination status. 
Samples were analysed using a PCR-based assay (SPF10-LiPA25). Type-specific and 
grouped VE estimates, adjusted with propensity score stratification, were 
assessed against genital positivity for 14 HPV types. VE for targeted and 
non-targeted genotypes were compared between women who had been eligible for the 
catch-up and those who had been eligible for routine vaccination.
RESULTS: The study included 4488 female participants who had been eligible for 
HPV vaccination and provided genital swabs (1561 eligible for catch-up, 2927 for 
routine vaccination). Very high VE against genital HPV-16 and HPV-18 was 
observed (resp. 93.5% and 89.5%) and significant cross-protection against six 
other genotypes (HPV-31/33/35/45/52/58), varying from 18.0% (HPV-52) to 79.6% 
(HPV-45). VE estimates were comparable between women who had been eligible for 
the catch-up campaign and those eligible for routine vaccination: VE 
HPV-16/HPV-18: 92.2% (95%CI: 87.9-94.9) vs. 91.8% (95%CI: 86.0-95.2).
CONCLUSIONS: In real-world settings, the VE of bivalent vaccine is high against 
targeted genotypes, with cross-protection against 6 other genotypes. Catch-up 
campaigns up to age 16 years can be as effective as routine vaccination at age 
12, although it is recommendable to provide HPV vaccination at an age at which 
most are likely not sexually active yet. This may inform countries considering 
catch-up campaigns when introducing or extending the use of HPV vaccination 
within their national immunisation programmes.
