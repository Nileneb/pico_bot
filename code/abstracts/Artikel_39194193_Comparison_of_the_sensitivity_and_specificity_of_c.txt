The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended that dengue 
pre-vaccination screening tests for Dengvaxia administration have at least 98% 
specificity and 75% sensitivity. This study evaluates the performance of 
commercial anti-DENV IgG tests to identify tests that could be used for 
pre-vaccination screening. First, for seven tests, we evaluated sensitivity and 
specificity in early convalescent dengue virus (DENV) infection, using 44 
samples collected 7-30 days after symptom onset and confirmed by RT-PCR. Next, 
for the five best-performing tests and two additional tests (with and without an 
external test reader) that became available later, we evaluated performance to 
detect past dengue infection among a panel of 44 specimens collected in 
2018-2019 from healthy 9- to 16-year-old children from Puerto Rico. Finally, a 
full-scale evaluation was done with the four best-performing tests using 400 
specimens from the same population. We used virus focus reduction neutralization 
test and an in-house DENV IgG ELISA as reference standards. Of seven tests, five 
showed ≥75% sensitivity in detecting anti-DENV IgG in early convalescent 
specimens with low cross-reactivity to the Zika virus. For the detection of 
previous DENV infections, the tests with the highest performance were the 
Euroimmun NS1 IgG ELISA (sensitivity 84.5%, specificity 97.1%) and CTK Dengue 
IgG rapid test R0065C with the test reader (sensitivity 76.2% specificity 
98.1%). There are IgG tests available that can be used to accurately classify 
individuals with previous DENV infection as eligible for dengue vaccination to 
support safe vaccine implementation.
IMPORTANCE: The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has set 
forth recommendations that dengue pre-vaccination screening tests must exhibit 
at least 98% specificity and 75% sensitivity. Our research rigorously assesses 
the performance of various commercial tests against these benchmarks using 
well-characterized specimens from Puerto Rico. The findings from our study are 
particularly relevant given FDA approval and ACIP recommendation of Sanofi 
Pasteur's Dengvaxia vaccine, highlighting the need for accurate pre-vaccination 
screening tools.
