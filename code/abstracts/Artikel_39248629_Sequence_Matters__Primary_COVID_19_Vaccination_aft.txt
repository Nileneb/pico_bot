Infection before primary vaccination (herein termed "hybrid immunity") engenders 
robust humoral immunity and broad Ab-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) 
across SARS-CoV-2 variants. We measured and compared plasma IgG and IgA against 
Wuhan-Hu-1 and Omicron (B.1.1.529) full-length spike (FLS) and receptor binding 
domain after three mRNA vaccines encoding Wuhan-Hu-1 spike (S) and after Omicron 
breakthrough infection. We also measured IgG binding to Wuhan-Hu-1 and Omicron 
S1, Wuhan-Hu-1 S2 and Wuhan-Hu-1 and Omicron cell-based S. We compared ADCC 
using human embryonic lung fibroblast (MRC-5) cells expressing Wuhan-Hu-1 or 
Omicron S. The effect of Omicron breakthrough infection on IgG anti-Wuhan-Hu-1 
and Omicron FLS avidity was also considered. Despite Omicron breakthrough 
infection increasing IgG and IgA against FLS and receptor binding domain to 
levels similar to those seen with hybrid immunity, there was no boost to ADCC. 
Preferential recognition of Wuhan-Hu-1 persisted following Omicron breakthrough 
infection, which increased IgG avidity against Wuhan-Hu-1 FLS. Despite similar 
total anti-FLS IgG levels following breakthrough infection, 4-fold higher plasma 
concentrations were required to elicit ADCC comparable to that elicited by 
hybrid immunity. The greater capacity for hybrid immunity to elicit ADCC was 
associated with a differential IgG reactivity pattern against S1, S2, and linear 
determinants throughout FLS. Immunity against SARS-CoV-2 following Omicron 
breakthrough infection manifests significantly less ADCC capacity than hybrid 
immunity. Thus, the sequence of antigenic exposure by infection versus 
vaccination and other factors such as severity of infection affect antiviral 
functions of humoral immunity in the absence of overt quantitative differences 
in the humoral response.
