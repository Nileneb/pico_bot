BACKGROUND: We evaluated co-administration of adjuvanted seasonal quadrivalent 
influenza vaccine (FLU-aQIV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prefusion F 
protein-based vaccine (RSVPreF3 OA) in ≥65-year-olds.
METHODS: This phase 3, open-label trial randomized ≥65-year-olds to receive 
FLU-aQIV and RSVPreF3 OA concomitantly (Co-Ad) or sequentially, 1 month apart 
(Control). Primary objectives were to demonstrate the non-inferiority of 
FLU-aQIV and RSVPreF3 OA co-administration versus sequential administration in 
terms of hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers for each FLU-aQIV strain and 
RSV-A and RSV-B neutralization titers, 1 month post-vaccination. Reactogenicity 
and safety were also assessed.
RESULTS: Overall, 1045 participants were vaccinated (Co-Ad: 523; Control: 522). 
Non-inferiority of FLU-aQIV and RSVPreF3 OA co-administration versus sequential 
administration was demonstrated in terms of HI titers for the A/Victoria(H1N1), 
B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata influenza strains and RSV-A neutralization titers 
(upper limits [ULs] of 95% confidence intervals [CIs] for adjusted geometric 
mean titer [GMT] ratios [Control/Co-Ad] ≤1.50) but not for A/Darwin(H3N2) HI 
titers (95% CI UL = 1.53). The immune response to A/Darwin(H3N2) was further 
assessed post-hoc using a microneutralization assay; the post-vaccination 
adjusted GMT ratio (Control/Co-Ad) was 1.23 (95% CI: 1.06-1.42, ie, UL ≤1.50), 
suggesting an adequate immune response to A/Darwin(H3N2) following 
co-administration. RSV-B neutralization titers were comparable between groups 
(95% CI UL for adjusted GMT ratio ≤1.50). Solicited adverse events were mostly 
mild or moderate and transient; unsolicited and serious adverse event rates were 
balanced between groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvanted FLU-aQIV and RSVPreF3 OA had acceptable 
reactogenicity/safety profiles when co-administered in ≥65-year-olds, without 
clinically relevant interference with the immune responses to either vaccine.
