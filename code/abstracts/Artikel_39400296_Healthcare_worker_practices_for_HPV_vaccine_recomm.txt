Healthcare workers (HCWs) are trusted sources of information for vaccination and 
their attitude toward vaccination is thus critical. We aimed to synthesize 
existing literature on healthcare workers' HPV vaccine confidence and their 
practices of recommending this vaccine. We conducted a systematic literature 
review and meta-analysis, with the search conducted last in March 2024. For the 
inclusion criteria, the studies needed to include healthcare worker practices or 
behaviors on recommending the HPV vaccination. Seventy-three articles were 
included. The proportions of HCWs recommending varied considerably by region and 
gender of the recipient, but there was no statistically significant difference 
in income level or pre- or post-HPV vaccine introduction into the national 
vaccination program. The main barriers to recommending HPV vaccination were 
concerns around safety and efficacy, cost, parental concerns, and systemic 
barriers. The results illustrate the importance of contextually adapted 
approaches to improving vaccine acceptance and recommendation.
