BACKGROUND: Studies have reported that repeated annual vaccination may influence 
influenza vaccination effectiveness in the current season.
METHODS: We established a 5-year randomized placebo-controlled trial of repeated 
influenza vaccination (Flublok; Sanofi Pasteur) in adults 18-45 years of age. In 
the first 2 years, participants were randomized to receive vaccine or saline 
placebo as follows: placebo-placebo (P-P), placebo-vaccine (P-V), or 
vaccine-vaccine (V-V). Serum samples were collected each year just before 
vaccination and after 30 and 182 days. A subset of serum samples collected at 5 
time points from 95 participants were tested for antibodies against vaccine 
strains.
RESULTS: From 23 October 2020 through 11 March 2021 we enrolled and randomized 
447 adults. Among vaccinated individuals, antibody titers increased between days 
0 and 30 against each of the vaccine strains, with smaller increases for repeat 
vaccinees who on average had higher prevaccination titers in year 2. There were 
statistically significant differences in the proportions of participants 
achieving ≥4-fold rises in antibody titer for the repeat vaccinees for influenza 
A(H1N1), B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata, but not for A(H3N2). Among participants who 
received vaccination in year 2, there were no significant differences between 
the P-V and V-V groups in geometric mean titers at day 30 or the proportions of 
participants with antibody titers ≥40 at day 30 for any of the vaccine strains.
CONCLUSIONS: In the first 2 years, during which influenza did not circulate, 
repeat and first-time vaccinees had similar postvaccination geometric mean 
titers to all 4 vaccine strains, indicative of similar levels of clinical 
protection. Clinical Trials Registration. NCT04576377.
