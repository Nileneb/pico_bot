BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes substantial respiratory 
disease. Bivalent RSV prefusion F (RSVpreF) vaccine is licensed in 
≥60-year-olds. RSVpreF was well tolerated and immunogenic in a phase 1/2 study. 
We evaluated antibody persistence after initial vaccination and safety and 
immunogenicity after revaccination from this study.
METHODS: Healthy adults were randomized to receive initial vaccination and 
revaccination 12 months later with either placebo or RSVpreF (240 µg with or 
without aluminum hydroxide). RSV-A and RSV-B geometric mean neutralizing titers 
(GMTs) were measured through 12 months after both vaccinations. Tolerability and 
safety were assessed.
RESULTS: There were 263 participants revaccinated (18-49 years old, n = 134; 
65-85 years old, n = 129). Among 18- to 49-year-olds and 65- to 85-year-olds, 
geometric mean fold rises (GMFRs) for both RSV subgroups (RSV-A, RSV-B) 1 month 
after initial RSVpreF vaccination were 13.3 to 20.4 and 8.9 to 15.5, 
respectively, as compared with levels before initial vaccination; corresponding 
GMFRs 12 months after initial vaccination were 4.1 to 5.0 and 2.6 to 4.1. GMFRs 
1 month after revaccination vs levels before revaccination were 1.4 to 2.3 and 
1.4 to 2.2 for 18- to 49-year-olds and 65- to 85-year-olds. Peak GMTs after 
revaccination were lower than those after initial vaccination. GMTs 12 months 
after initial vaccination and revaccination were similar, with GMFRs ranging 
from 0.7 to 1.6. No safety signals occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: RSVpreF revaccination was immunogenic and well tolerated among 
adults. Clinical Trials Registration. NCT03529773 (ClinicalTrials.gov).
