BACKGROUND: The adjuvanted respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prefusion F 
protein-based vaccine (RSVPreF3 OA) is approved in adults aged ≥60 years. We 
evaluated RSVPreF3 OA immunogenicity and safety in adults aged 50-59 years 
without or with increased risk for RSV disease due to specific chronic medical 
conditions.
METHODS: This observer-blind, phase 3, noninferiority trial included adults aged 
50-59 years, stratified into 2 subcohorts: those with and those without 
predefined, stable, chronic medical conditions leading to an increased risk for 
RSV disease. Participants in both subcohorts were randomized 2:1 to receive 
RSVPreF3 OA or placebo. A control group of adults aged ≥60 years received 
RSVPreF3 OA. Primary outcomes were RSV-A and RSV-B neutralization titers 
(geometric mean titer ratios and sero-response rate differences) 1 month 
post-vaccination in 50-59-year-olds versus ≥60-year-olds. Cell-mediated immunity 
and safety were also assessed.
RESULTS: The exposed population included 1152 participants aged 50-59 years and 
381 participants aged ≥60 years. RSVPreF3 OA was immunologically noninferior in 
50-59-year-olds versus ≥60-year-olds; noninferiority criteria were met for RSV-A 
and RSV-B neutralization titers in those with and those without increased risk 
for RSV disease. Frequencies of RSVPreF3-specific polyfunctional CD4+ T cells 
increased substantially from pre- to 1 month post-vaccination. Most solicited 
adverse events had mild-to-moderate intensity and were transient. Unsolicited 
and serious adverse event rates were similar in all groups.
CONCLUSIONS: RSVPreF3 OA was immunologically noninferior in 50-59-year-olds 
compared to ≥60-year-olds, in whom efficacy was previously demonstrated. The 
safety profile in 50-59-year-olds was consistent with that in ≥60-year-olds.
