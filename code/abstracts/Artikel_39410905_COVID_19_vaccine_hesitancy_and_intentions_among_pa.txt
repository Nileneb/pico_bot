Parent vaccine hesitancy (PVH) remains a significant public health concern, 
particularly emphasized during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study investigates 
PVH among parents of children with various psychiatric and neurodevelopmental 
conditions, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety 
disorders, and behavioral disturbances, extending previous research focused on 
autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We examined PVH in children aged 5-11 years with 
psychiatric and behavioral disorders excluding ASD. A cross-sectional 
questionnaire-based analysis was conducted in Qatar, involving 244 parents of 
neurodiverse children and 245 parents of neurotypical children as controls. The 
Parent Attitudes about Childhood Vaccines (PACV) survey assessed PVH. Results 
indicated a significantly higher prevalence of vaccine hesitancy among parents 
of children with psychiatric disorders (54.1%, 95% CI [47.8%, 60.4%], n = 132) 
compared to controls (11.7%, 95% CI [7.5%, 16.0%], n = 26), p < .001. The PACV 
total score was significantly higher in parents of children with a mental 
disorder. Higher education among parents and lower PACV scores significantly 
influenced the intent to vaccinate against COVID-19. Tailored interventions by 
child and adolescent mental healthcare professionals, such as harnessing 
artificial intelligence to fight disinformation, are crucial to addressing 
vaccine hesitancy, enhancing acceptance, and improving outcomes for children 
with psychiatric disorders.
